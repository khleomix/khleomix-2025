# Development Workflow

## Project Setup
- All dependencies must be managed through Composer for PHP and npm for JavaScript
- Plugin dependencies should be defined in the root composer.json
- Theme and block dependencies should be managed in their respective package.json files

## Version Control
- Use semantic versioning for all plugins and themes
- Commit messages should follow conventional commits format
- Feature branches should be created from develop branch
- Pull requests must be reviewed before merging

## Development Process
- Local development will be done outside of the repository using Local by Flywheel
- All new features must include unit tests
- Code must pass PHPCS and ESLint checks before committing
- Documentation must be updated for all new features

## Deployment
- Production deployments should be automated
- Database migrations must be handled through WP-CLI
- Asset compilation must be part of the build process
- Environment-specific configurations must be managed through .env files
